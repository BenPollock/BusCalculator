== Bus Factor Calculator

*Description*

This application was created for our 'FedEx' day during my employment at GoodLife Fitness.  We are given less than 24 hours to create and demo a quick project that we believe would be an asset to the organization.  Due to time constraints, most features are not implemented but serve to give a view of what the application would do, if given more time.

This application is designed to track the 'bus factor' of each project.  The bus factor is the number of developers that would need to be incapacitated (ie 'hit by a bus') before a project would be rendered useless.  Users can request to shadow a project to ensure information is spread throughout all interested parties.
